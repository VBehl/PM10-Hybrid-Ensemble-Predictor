#🔍 PM10-Hybrid-Ensemble-Predictor
A machine learning pipeline to forecast PM₁₀ concentration using a meta-ensemble framework that integrates XGBoost, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and a Random Forest meta-learner for robust, high-accuracy air quality prediction.

---

#🚀 Project Overview
This project improves air quality forecasting by combining advanced regression models in a stacked ensemble:

- **XGBoost** models structured interactions and handles feature sparsity.
- **ANN** captures complex non-linear dependencies in environmental data.
- **Random Forest** meta-model fuses predictions from both models for robust output.
- Focus is placed on handling data imbalance and ensuring high generalization across varying pollution levels.
